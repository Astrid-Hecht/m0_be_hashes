# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
  * I kept forgetting that `each` statements that contain an `if` need to have two `end`s

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
  * It's good! Probably during the live lessons.

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
  * It really depends. If I feel like I don't have enough information or don't know specifically how a method works or even what methods are available, I'll go to google, but if I'm just stuck on something or getting an error, I'll try to figure it out myself.
